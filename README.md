# Niche Demo - Google Search Suggestions Analyzer

This web application allows you to analyze Google search suggestions for multiple keywords. It features a split-panel interface where you can:

1. Enter multiple keywords in the left panel
2. View simulated Google search suggestions for each keyword in the right panel

## Features
- Two-panel interface
- Multi-keyword input support
- Simulated typing animation
- Mock search suggestions display

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Enter keywords in the left panel (one per line)
3. Click "Start Analysis" to begin
4. Watch as each keyword is typed into the search box and suggestions appear

## Note
This is a demo version that uses mock suggestions. To get real Google search suggestions, you would need to:
1. Set up a backend server to handle CORS
2. Implement proper API integration with Google's services
3. Handle rate limiting and API keys appropriately

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with actual Google Search API
- Save and export functionality
- Analysis and visualization of suggestion patterns
